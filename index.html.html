    <h1>Our Environment - An Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Environment is our basic life support system and is composed of living beings, physical surroundings, and climatic conditions. It is derived from a French word, “Environner”, which means “to surround”. The term environment includes all biotic and abiotic entities around us. Biotic refers to the world of living organisms, whereas Abiotic refers to the world of non-living elements. The Environment provides us with the essential elements – air, water, food, and land which are essential for life to flourish on the Earth.
